 SUSVDFILT - SVD (Eigen) filter					

 susvdfilt <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]			

 Required parameters:							
    none							       

 Optional parameters:						  
    ntrw=all traces   number of traces in window		       
    verbose=0	 1 = echo additional information		  

    numpp=1	   number of principal planes to retain	     
    subtract=1	subtarct selected principal planes from i/p      
	     0	output selected principal planes		 

    tmpdir=	   if non-empty, use the value as a directory path  
		       prefix for storing temporary files; else if the  
		       the CWP_TMPDIR environment variable is set use   
		       its value for the path; else use tmpfile()       


 Notes:								
    Input data is windowed to give an area of twlen x ntrw samples     
    which is then decomposed to into eigen vectors (by SVD) and	
    eigenvalues. A percentage of these are selected for inverse	
    transform this can be subtracted from input if difference is       
    required.							  

 Caveat:							       
 The pre-requiste is your target event has to be pre-flattened using NMO,
 LMO or other static correction. Works well to remove direct wave from
 marine seismic data for those of you interested in seismic oceanography.

 The code really needs someone to make the windowing work in both time 
 and space. However as it stands it works, it has excellent amplitude 	
 response and exhibits minimal edge effects.
