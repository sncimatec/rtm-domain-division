 SUICLOGFFT - fft of complex log frequency traces to real time traces

  suiclogftt <stdin >sdout sign=-1				

 Required parameters:						
 	none							

 Optional parameter:						
 	sign=-1		sign in exponent of inverse fft		
	sym=0		=1 center  output 			
 Output traces are normalized by 1/N where N is the fft size.	

 Note:								
 Nominally this is the inverse to the complex log fft, but	
 suclogfft | suiclogfft is not quite a no-op since the trace	
 	length will usually be longer due to fft padding.	


 Example:  Homomorphic wavelet estimation                              
 suclogfft < shotgather | suamp mode=real | sustack key=dt > real.su   
 suclogfft < shotgather | suamp mode=imag | sustack key=dt > imag.su   
 suop2 real.su imag.su op=zipper | suiclogfft | suminphase > wavelet.su
