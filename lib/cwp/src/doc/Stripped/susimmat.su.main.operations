 SUSIMAT - Correlation similarity matrix for two traces.		
 		 Output is zero lag of cross-correlation of traces,	
 		 or linear regression correlation coefficient.		
 		 Horizontal axis is time of trace 1, vertical is trace 2.

 susimmat <data12 sufile=data2 >dataout 				

 Required parameters:							
 sufile=		file containing SU traces to use as filter	

 Optional parameters:							
 panel=0		use only the first trace of sufile as filter	
 		      	=1 compute sim matrix trace by trace an entire  
                        gather						
 mt=21			operator window length (odd integer)		
 eps=1e-3		stability parameter				
 taper=0		no taper to data fragments			
 			=1 apply exponential taper (1/e at ends)	
 method=1		use xcorrelation as similarity meausure		
 			=2 same but normalized by (rms+eps)		
 			=3 use linear regression CC			
 			=4 use mt-dimensional vector angle		

 EXAMPLE PROCESSING SEQUENCES:						
   1. Look for all possible alignments of OBC P and Z data  		
   	susimmat < P_Z.su sufile=OBC_P.su  mt=71 > P_Zxcor.su		

 Note:  xcor window is collapsed as needed to compute edge values	
 It is quietly assumed that the time sampling interval on the  single  
 trace									
 and the output traces is the same as that on the traces in the input  
 file.  								
 The sufile may actually have more than one trace, but only the first  
 trace is used when panel=0. When panel=1 the number of traces in the 
 sufile MUST be  the same as the number of traces in the input.
