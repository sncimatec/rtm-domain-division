For Ubuntu 14.04 (and possibly for other UBUNTU):

Use the default Makefile.config

Please note that not everything is installed
when you do a basic installation of the UBUNTU operating system.

You may get error messages of the form:
   fatal error: X11/Intrinsic.h

or errors about  libxm.a or libxmu.a 

These may be solved by the installation of additional items:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get synaptic
sudo apt-get libmgl-dev
sudo apt-get freeglut-dev
sudo apt-get libxi-dev
sudo apt-get lbxmu-dev
sudo apt-get gfortran


Note that "synaptic" refers to the "Synaptic Package Manager"
which may be used to install other items that are not included
in the default installation of the UBUNTU operating system.
