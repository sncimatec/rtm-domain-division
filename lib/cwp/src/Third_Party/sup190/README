Simple utilities to read one or more P1/90 files and transfer their projected
coordinates into SU trace headers sx, sy, gx, gy, swdep, gelev.  For the Mac,
you will likely need to install the gdbm library.  If building it from source,
I recommend configuring it with the command script:

	#!/bin/sh -v
	CC=/usr/bin/gcc ./configure --prefix=${CWPROOT}

after which you run "make install" before starting any build in this
sup190 source directory.
